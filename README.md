# Komodo Crypto

Komodo Crypto integrates with the following exchanges:
  - Binance
  - Bitstamp
  - Bittrex
  - GDAX
  - Kraken
  
## Deployment

### API Keys

In order to run Komodo Crypto, you will need verified accounts and API keys for 
each of our integrated exchanges. You can enter your specific credentials into the 
`application.properties` file in the `resources` directory. Please note, it can 
sometimes take some time to verify your account, and if you have an account with 
coins in it be careful before running any methods that will make actual changes 
to your account.  

### Databases

Create a table to hold OAuth2 Client Credentials using the following SQL statement. 
```
create table oauth_client_details (
  client_id VARCHAR(256) PRIMARY KEY,
  resource_ids VARCHAR(256),
  client_secret VARCHAR(256),
  scope VARCHAR(256),
  authorized_grant_types VARCHAR(256),
  web_server_redirect_uri VARCHAR(256),
  authorities VARCHAR(256),
  access_token_validity INTEGER,
  refresh_token_validity INTEGER,
  additional_information VARCHAR(4096),
  autoapprove VARCHAR(256)
);
```

## Security
The Komodo API is secured with OAuth2. To access secure endpoints you need to exchange your client
credentials for an access token.

You can register client credentials by making a POST request to the Authorization Server with your email as the
client_id and a client_secret of your choosing.

```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"client_id": "{YOUR_EMAIL_HERE}", "client_secret": "temp-secret", "authorized_grant_types":"client_credentials"}' http://localhost:8080/oauth/client
```

In order to obtain an access token
you should make a POST request to the Authorization Server with your client credentials.
```
curl -X POST --user '{YOUR_EMAIL_HERE}:temp-secret' -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' http://localhost:8080/oauth/token
```

This will return an access token that will expire after the allotted time has passed.
You can make a request to any endpoint using the access token in the authorization header.
```
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" http://localhost:8080/test-security
```
