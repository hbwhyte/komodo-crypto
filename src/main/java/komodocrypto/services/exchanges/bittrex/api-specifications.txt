Bittrex Exchange API specification
================================

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
https://bittrex.com/home/api

Bittrex provides a simple and powerful REST API to allow you to programatically perform
nearly all actions you can from our web interface. All requests use the application/json
content type and go over https. The base url is https://bittrex.com/api/{version}/.

All requests are GET requests and all responses come in a default response object with
the result in the result field. Always check the success flag to ensure that your API
call succeeded.
